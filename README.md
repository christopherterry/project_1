## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

Project_1.drawio

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network.
-the advantage of having a load balancer is that you can have your web servers available to the internet using HTTP/HTTPS with out exposing SSH to the internet. You then can use a jump box that is only accessible from a very select IP addresses from the internet via SSH and then connect with SSH to the local network with the jump box.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the event logs and system metrics.
- Filbeats watch for log directories or specific log files.
- Metricbeat helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics from the system and services running on the server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web1     | Server   | 10.1.0.9   | Linux            |
| Web2     | Server   | 10.1.0.10  | Linux            |
|ELK Server|Log Server| 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 65.49.85.109

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the Jump Box.
- The Elk Machine can have access from 65.49.85.109 through port 22.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name         |   Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box     | Yes                   | 65.49.85.109         |
| Load Balancer|	Yes                   | Open                 |
|Web 1         | No                    | 10.1.0.9             |
|Web 2         | No                    | 10.1.0.10            |
|ELK Server    |	Yes                   | 65.49.85.109         |                     ---------------------------------------------------------------


### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because servcies running can be limited, system installation and update can be streamlined, and processes become more replicable.


The playbook implements the following tasks:
- installs docker.io, pip3, and the docker module.
  # Use apt module
    - name: Install docker.io
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name: docker.io
        state: present

  # Use apt module
    - name: Install pip3
      apt:
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: python3-pip
        state: present

  # Use pip module
    - name: Install Docker python module
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present
- increases the virtual memory (for the virtual machine we will use to run the ELK server)
  # Use command module
    - name: Increase virtual memory
      command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
- uses sysctl module
  # Use sysctl module
    - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:
        name: vm.max_map_count
        value: "262144"
        state: present
        reload: yes
- downloads and launches the docker container for elk server
# Use docker_container module
    - name: download and launch a docker elk container
      docker_container:
        name: elk
        image: sebp/elk:761
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        published_ports:
          - 5601:5601
          - 9200:9200
          - 5044:5044

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.



### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.1.0.9
- 10.1.0.10

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- FileBeat
-Metric Beat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat is a log data shipper for local files. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log directories or specific log files, tails the files, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing. An examle of such are the logs produced from the MySQL database supporting our application.
- Metricbeat collects metrics and statistics on the system. An example of such is cpu usage, which can be used to monitor the system health.

### Using the Playbook

In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the configuration file to you web VM???s.
- Update the /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the ip address of the ELK Server VM and webservers.

- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://20.83.226.255:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Filebeat-config.yml and copy it from copy /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml to /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml

- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? You update filebeat-config.yml -- specify which machine to install by updating the host files with ip addresses of web/elk servers and selecting which group to run on in ansible

- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://20.83.226.255:5601/app/kibana

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
